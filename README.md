Cat Forum

This application is a forum where users can discuss about cats

Users can register to the forum and read or write about cats on different subtopics There are two types of users. Normal users can start a new dicsussion thread, find threads based on keywords, write on threads and upload pictures on threads. Root users can modify messages and thread headings. They can also delete users, threads or comments in addition to the functions of the normal user. Root user also has the ability to create private threads that are for invite only.

When opening the forum, firstly the user needs to either register or sign in. Then they will see a list of threads with information on how many messages are on that thread and when the thread was created. The first thread will always be the one with the most messages and the rest will be in order of when the last message was sent.

At this moment most of the background of the app is working but the design of the webpage is very elementary. Also the threads and messages don't line up correctly at the moment. Also the vote page and admin page are not done.
